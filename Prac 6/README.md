# First computer practical

This practical serves to make sure all students have some basic level of R. For some students the practical will thus be very easy and short, whereas others may need to work on it a bit longer. Note that many students underestimate the external tutorial.

# Plotting

Here, we explicitly chose to not use plotting. The goal of the practical was getting students to understand some R bascis. Our concept behind it was that students should not learn how to use 1001 different libraries, but rather they should get some good grip on R fundamentals, on which they can then easily build to use any package they find later.
